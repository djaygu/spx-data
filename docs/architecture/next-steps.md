# Next Steps

## For Development Team

1. **Set up development environment:**
   - Install Bun 1.1.0
   - Clone repository
   - Run `bun install`
   - Configure ThetaData Terminal

2. **Begin Epic 1 implementation:**
   - Start with Story 1.1: Project Setup
   - Follow TDD approach for all development
   - Use Effect-TS patterns from technical preferences

3. **Key implementation notes:**
   - All services must have Test implementations
   - Use expiration-based parallelization (not strike batching)
   - Target 1-minute tick data from bulk history endpoints
   - Organize files by trade date directory

## For Product Owner

1. **Review simplified architecture:**
   - No strike batching complexity
   - Simple retry mechanism for MVP
   - JSON-based status tracking

2. **Validate technical decisions:**
   - Bun runtime selection
   - 1-minute tick data granularity
   - Expiration-based processing approach

3. **Prepare for Epic 2:**
   - Consider Parquet library options
   - Plan for increased storage needs with 1-minute data

## Development Prompts

**For Dev Agent:**
```
Using the SPX Options Data Pipeline architecture document, implement Story 1.1 (Project Setup and Core Architecture) following strict TDD practices. Use Effect-TS service layer pattern with Bun runtime.
```

**For QA Agent:**
```
Review the test strategy in the SPX Options Data Pipeline architecture and create comprehensive test scenarios for the download orchestrator's expiration-based parallel processing.
