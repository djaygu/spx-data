# Story 1.6: Integration Tests and Documentation

**Story ID**: 1.6  
**Epic**: Epic 1 - Foundation & Streaming Pipeline  
**Status**: Ready for Review  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day (focused on gaps only)  
**Created**: 2025-08-08  
**Approved**: 2025-08-08 by Sarah (PO)  

## User Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** comprehensive error handling tests and missing documentation,  
**So that** the system handles edge cases properly and is fully documented.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: All Epic 1 services (ThetaDataApiClient, BulkGreeksProcessor, DataPipeline, CLI commands)
- Technology: Bun test framework, Effect-TS test utilities, Markdown documentation
- Follows pattern: Existing test patterns from unit and integration tests
- Touch points: All service boundaries and CLI entry points

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Create end-to-end test that downloads real data for a sample date
2. Add integration tests for error propagation, concurrency limits, and stream cleanup
3. Enhance README with detailed ThetaData Terminal setup, Java requirements, and startup process
4. Include troubleshooting guide for common issues
5. Verify single binary deployment works on clean system without dependencies

**Integration Requirements:**
6. Existing test suite continues to pass without regression
7. New tests follow existing test patterns and directory structure
8. Integration tests properly isolate with TestLive layers

**Quality Requirements:**
9. Test coverage reaches 80% or higher for core services
10. Documentation is clear and accurate with working examples

## Dev Notes

### Test Organization
Following the existing test structure:
- Unit tests: `test/services/*.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `test/integration/*.test.ts`
- E2E tests: `test/e2e/*.test.ts` (new directory)
- Performance tests: `test/performance/*.test.ts` (new directory)

### Test Execution Strategy
- Unit tests: Always run (fast, no external dependencies)
- Integration tests: Run when THETA_DATA_TERMINAL_URL is set
- E2E tests: Run manually or in nightly CI builds
- Performance tests: Run on demand with `bun test:perf`

### Documentation Structure
Current documentation organization:
- `/docs/architecture/` - Technical architecture docs
- `/docs/prd/` - Product requirements
- `/docs/stories/` - User stories
- `/docs/usage-examples/` - Code examples
- `/README.md` - Main project documentation
- `/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - New troubleshooting guide

### Binary Compilation with Bun
Two build modes available:

**Current (JavaScript bundle - requires Bun runtime):**
```bash
bun run build  # Uses scripts/build.ts, outputs JS file with #!/usr/bin/env bun
```

**Standalone Binary (no Bun runtime needed):**
```bash
bun build ./src/cli.ts --compile --outfile dist/spx-data
```

The compiled binary embeds the Bun runtime and all dependencies (Effect-TS, etc.) creating a self-contained executable that runs on systems without Bun installed.

## Testing

### Test Standards
- Follow TDD approach where practical
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Group related tests using describe blocks
- Mock external dependencies with TestLive layers
- Use beforeAll/afterAll for setup/cleanup
- Tag long-running tests appropriately

### Coverage Goals
- Core services: 80% minimum
- CLI commands: 70% minimum
- Utilities: 90% minimum
- Overall project: 75% minimum
