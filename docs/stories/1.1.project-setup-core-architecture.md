# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Core Architecture

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to establish the Effect-TS project structure with proper service layers,
**so that** I have a solid foundation for building the data pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Initialize TypeScript project with strict mode, Bun runtime, and Effect-TS dependencies
2. Create project structure with clear separation: /src/services, /src/cli, /src/models, /src/layers
3. Implement base service layer architecture with Context.Tag pattern
4. Set up Effect test framework with example service and test layer using Bun test runner
5. Configure Bun build system to produce single executable binary
6. Create basic Effect Config service for environment variables
7. Implement "health check" CLI command that verifies Effect runtime and Terminal connection

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists - this is the first story of the project.

### Data Models
No specific data models needed for this story. Focus is on project setup and infrastructure.

### API Specifications
ThetaData Terminal base URL: http://127.0.0.1:25510 [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#base-urls]
Health check endpoint: /v2/system/mdds/status [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#integration-notes]

### Component Specifications
No UI components - CLI-only application.

### File Locations
Based on architecture/source-tree.md:
- Service interfaces: src/services/
- Service implementations: src/layers/
- CLI commands: src/cli/commands/
- Configuration: src/config/
- Types and errors: src/types/
- Tests: test/ (mirroring src structure)

### Testing Requirements
- Test framework: @effect/vitest 0.5.0 [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
- Test file convention: {module}.test.ts in /test directory
- Use Effect Test layers for mocking (no external mocking needed)
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Automatic cleanup using Effect.addFinalizer

### Technical Constraints
- Runtime: Bun 1.1.0 [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Language: TypeScript 5.3.3 with strict mode
- All Effect services must have Test implementations [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- Never use console.log - use Effect.log instead
- Service interfaces must use Context.Tag pattern
- All async operations must use Effect.tryPromise

### Testing
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- Test Location: /test directory mirroring /src structure [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
- Test Framework: @effect/vitest 0.5.0 with Bun test runner
- Test Pattern: Strict TDD - Red, Green, Refactor approach
- Test Layers: Create TestEnvironmentLive layer composition as shown in architecture
- Coverage Goal: 90% for services, 80% for utilities
- Mock Strategy: Use Effect Test layers, no external mocking libraries needed

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-05

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

Overall, the implementation demonstrates good understanding of Effect-TS patterns and project structure. The developer has successfully implemented all acceptance criteria with proper service layer architecture using Context.Tag pattern, comprehensive test setup, and functional build system. The code follows Effect-TS best practices and maintains clean separation of concerns.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: src/layers/ThetaDataApiClientLive.ts
  - **Change**: Enhanced error handling in makeRequest function
  - **Why**: Original error messages lacked context when Terminal connection failed
  - **How**: Added response status text extraction, better error message formatting, and warning logs for connection failures to help with debugging

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Code follows Effect-TS patterns and TypeScript strict mode
- Project Structure: ✓ Directory structure matches architecture/source-tree.md exactly
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Tests use Effect Test layers, follow AAA pattern
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified

### Improvements Checklist

[x] Enhanced error handling in ThetaDataApiClientLive for better debugging
[ ] Consider adding retry logic for transient API failures
[ ] Add integration tests for actual ThetaData Terminal connection (when available)
[ ] Consider implementing connection pooling for high-frequency API calls
[ ] Add performance monitoring/metrics collection for API calls

### Security Review

No security issues found. API credentials are not hardcoded, base URL is configurable via environment variables, and no sensitive data is logged.

### Performance Considerations

Current implementation is performant for initial setup. Future considerations:
- Connection pooling may be needed for high-frequency trading scenarios
- Consider implementing request batching for bulk operations
- Monitor API rate limits and implement throttling if needed

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done
