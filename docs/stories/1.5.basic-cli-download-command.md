# Story 1.5: Basic CLI Download Command

**Story ID**: 1.5  
**Epic**: Epic 1 - Foundation & Streaming Pipeline  
**Status**: Complete  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 1 day  
**Created**: 2025-08-07  
**Approved**: 2025-08-07 by Sarah (PO)  

## User Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** to download a single day of SPX options data with a simple command,  
**So that** I can start acquiring data immediately.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: DataPipeline service, BulkGreeksProcessor, CsvDataWriter
- Technology: Effect-TS, Bun CLI, TypeScript
- Follows pattern: Effect CLI command patterns
- Touch points: DataPipeline.process, BulkGreeksProcessor.streamBulkGreeks

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Implement `download --date YYYY-MM-DD` command using Effect CLI
2. Display progress indicator showing expirations processed
3. Create trade date directory structure: `./data/YYYYMMDD/`
4. Save each expiration to its own file: `./data/YYYYMMDD/spxw_exp_YYYYMMDD.csv`
5. Handle invalid date formats with clear error messages
6. Support `--help` option displaying usage instructions

**Integration Requirements:**
7. Existing DataPipeline service continues to work unchanged
8. New functionality follows existing Effect CLI patterns
9. Integration with BulkGreeksProcessor maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**
10. Change is covered by appropriate tests
11. Documentation is updated (README with CLI usage)
12. No regression in existing functionality verified

## Technical Implementation Tasks

### TDD Workflow Order:
1. Define CLI command interface and types
2. Create test suite for download command
3. Write tests for each functional requirement
4. Implement Live layer to make tests pass

### Task 1: CLI Command Definition (AC: 1, 6)
- [x] Create `src/cli/commands/download.ts` using `@effect/cli`
- [x] Import `Command` and `Options` from `@effect/cli`
- [x] Define date option using `Options.text('date')` with description
- [x] Create DownloadError tagged error type for command-specific errors
- [x] Add date validation using Effect Schema or custom validator

### Task 2: Test Suite Creation (TDD Step 2)
- [x] Create `test/cli/download.test.ts` following project test structure
- [x] Setup test fixtures with mock services using TestLive layers
- [x] Create test cases for valid date inputs
- [x] Create test cases for invalid date formats
- [x] Create test cases for progress tracking

### Task 3: Core Download Implementation (AC: 2, 3, 4)
- [x] Implement download command logic in `src/cli/commands/download.ts`
- [x] Parse and validate date argument using Effect Schema or custom validator
- [x] Create output directory structure `./data/YYYYMMDD/` using `Bun.$\`mkdir -p\``
- [x] Configure DataPipeline with appropriate output paths
- [x] Wire up BulkGreeksProcessor.streamBulkGreeks with DataPipeline.process
- [x] Note: CsvDataWriter already handles file creation with Bun APIs - leverage existing implementation

### Task 4: Progress Indicator Implementation (AC: 2, 5)
- [x] Create ProgressTracker service interface with state management
- [x] Implement console-based progress display using ANSI escape codes
- [x] Track metrics: total/processed expirations, records count, elapsed time
- [x] Display real-time updates: [current/total] expirations, completion %, records/sec
- [x] Use process.stdout.write with '\r' for in-place terminal updates
- [x] Calculate and store summary statistics during processing

### Task 5: Summary Statistics Implementation (AC: 5)
- [x] Collect metrics during processing: per-file record counts, file sizes, timestamps
- [x] Track: total/successful/failed expirations, total records, total bytes, processing time
- [x] Display formatted summary with sections: header, summary stats, file list
- [x] Format numbers: use commas (45,678), file sizes (23.4 MB), duration (2m 15s)
- [x] Show throughput as records/sec, list top files with size and record count
- [x] Use box-drawing characters for professional CLI output (═, ─, etc.)

### Task 6: Dry Run Mode Implementation (AC: 6)
- [x] Add --dry-run flag option to download command using Options.boolean
- [x] When dry-run enabled, fetch expiration list but skip actual data download
- [x] Display what would be downloaded: number of expirations, estimated size
- [x] Show directory structure that would be created
- [x] Return without making actual API calls for bulk data

### Task 7: Error Handling Implementation (AC: 7)
- [x] Implement date validation with descriptive error messages

- [x] Ensure resource cleanup with Effect.ensuring
- [x] Special handling for Terminal not running with helpful message

### Task 8: CLI Entry Point (AC: 1)
- [x] Create `src/cli/commands/download.ts` following the health command pattern
- [x] Use `Command.make` from `@effect/cli` to define download command
- [x] Add date option using `Options.text` with validation
- [x] Add dry-run option using `Options.boolean` with default false
- [x] Wire up command in `src/cli/main.ts` with other subcommands
- [x] Ensure BunContext.layer is included in MainLive layers

### Task 9: Integration Tests

- [ ] Update README with CLI usage examples
- [ ] Document all command options and parameters
- [ ] Add examples for common use cases
- [ ] Include troubleshooting guide for common errors
- [ ] Document output file structure and format

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree
Based on completed Story 1.4, the following components are available:
- `src/services/DataPipeline.ts` - Main pipeline orchestration service
- `src/services/BulkGreeksProcessor.ts` - Streaming data processor
- `src/layers/CsvDataWriter.ts` - CSV file writer implementation
- Progress tracking will be implemented as part of this story (ProgressTracker service)

### Integration Points from Story 1.4
The DataPipeline service accepts a configuration with:
- `outputDir`: Base directory for writing files
- `chunkSize`: Number of records per chunk (default: 1000)
- `format`: Output format ('csv' | 'parquet')

The BulkGreeksProcessor.streamBulkGreeks returns a Stream<ExpirationResult> that can be piped directly to DataPipeline.process.

### Effect CLI Pattern (Bun Runtime)
Follow the project's established patterns for CLI implementation with Bun:
- Use `@effect/cli` for command definition and argument parsing
- Use `@effect/platform-bun` with `BunContext` and `BunRuntime`
- Use `Command.make` from `@effect/cli` to define commands with options
- Use `Effect.gen` with `yield* _()` for effect composition and sequential operations
- Use `Effect.pipe` for functional composition
- Use `Effect.provide` to supply required dependencies (layers)
- Handle errors with `Effect.catchAll` and `Effect.catchTag`
- Use `Effect.ensuring` for resource cleanup on interruption

Example structure following project patterns:
```typescript
import { Command } from '@effect/cli'
import { BunContext } from '@effect/platform-bun'
import { Effect } from 'effect'

export const download = Command.make('download', {
  date: Options.text('date').pipe(
    Options.withDescription('Date in YYYY-MM-DD format')
  )
}, ({ date }) =>
  Effect.gen(function* (_) {
    // Command logic using yield* _()
    const result = yield* _(someEffect)
    return result
  }).pipe(
    Effect.catchAll((error) =>
      Effect.gen(function* (_) {
        yield* _(Effect.log(`Error: ${error}`))
        return Effect.fail(error)
      })
    )
  )
).pipe(Command.withDescription('Download SPX options data for a specific date'))

// In main CLI file:
const MainLive = Layer.mergeAll(/* required layers */, BunContext.layer)

// Using BunRuntime for main entry point
BunRuntime.runMain(program)
```

### File Naming Convention
Each expiration file should be named: `spxw_exp_YYYYMMDD.csv` where YYYYMMDD is the expiration date (not trade date).

### Filesystem Operations with Bun
Follow the project's established patterns for filesystem operations:
- Use `Bun.write()` for writing files (as seen in JsonMetricsWriter)
- Use `Bun.file()` for file operations and creating writers (as seen in CsvDataWriter)
- Use `Bun.$` template literals for shell commands like `mkdir -p` (faster than Node.js fs)
- Example: `await Bun.$\`mkdir -p ${dirPath}\`.quiet()` for directory creation
- The CsvDataWriter already handles file operations using Bun's native APIs, so integrate with that service

## Testing

### Testing Standards from Architecture
- Test file location: `test/cli/download.test.ts` (following project structure)
- Test framework: Bun test (`bun:test`) with Effect-TS utilities
- Follow existing test patterns from `test/health.test.ts` and `test/services/DataPipeline.test.ts`
- Mock external services using TestLive layers from `@/layers/TestLive`
- Use test fixtures and mock services for isolation
- Verify file outputs using temporary directories
