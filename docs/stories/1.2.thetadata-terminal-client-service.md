# Story 1.2: ThetaData Terminal Client Service

**Story ID**: 1.2  
**Epic**: Epic 1 - Foundation & Streaming Pipeline  
**Status**: Ready for Review  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 days  
**Agent Model Used**: claude-opus-4-1-20250805  
**Completion Date**: 2025-08-06  

## User Story

**As a** system,  
**I want** a robust API client service that connects to the local ThetaData Terminal,  
**So that** I can reliably retrieve SPX options data with proper error handling and rate limiting.

## Context

Following the completion of Story 1.1 (Project Setup and Core Architecture), we now have:
- Effect-TS project structure with service layers
- Base service architecture with Context.Tag pattern
- Config service for environment variables
- Test framework with Bun test runner
- CLI structure with health check command

This story builds upon that foundation to create the critical connection to our data source.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. ThetaDataApiClient Service Implementation
- [x] Implement ThetaDataApiClient service using Effect HTTP client
- [x] Configure base URL to http://127.0.0.1:25510
- [x] Use Effect Context.Tag pattern consistent with existing services
- [x] Implement proper service layer with Live and Test implementations

### 2. Terminal Health Check
- [x] Add health check method that verifies Terminal is running
- [x] Validate `/v2/system/mdds/status` endpoint is accessible
- [x] Return structured status with CONNECTED|UNVERIFIED|DISCONNECTED|ERROR states
- [x] Map MDDS response to domain model (e.g., `{ isConnected: boolean, status: string, timestamp: Date }`)
- [x] Integrate with existing CLI health command

### 3. Concurrency Management
- [x] Implement configurable concurrency limiting (default: 2, max: 4)
- [x] Use Effect's concurrency primitives (Semaphore or similar)
- [x] Make concurrency configurable via AppConfig service
- [x] Ensure concurrent requests don't overwhelm Terminal

### 4. Retry Logic & Error Handling
- [x] Add exponential backoff retry logic for transient failures
- [x] Configure max retries (default: 3) and base delay (default: 1000ms)
- [x] Distinguish between retryable and non-retryable errors
- [x] Handle specific ThetaData error codes appropriately

### 5. Test Coverage
- [x] Create ThetaDataApiClientTest layer with mocked responses
- [x] Test success scenarios for all API methods
- [x] Test failure scenarios (connection refused, timeout, error responses)
- [x] Test retry logic with various failure patterns
- [x] Test concurrency limiting behavior

### 6. Logging & Observability
- [x] Log all API requests with timestamp, endpoint, and parameters
- [x] Log all API responses with status code and timing
- [x] Use Effect's Logger service with appropriate log levels
- [x] Include request ID for tracing concurrent requests

### 7. API Methods Implementation
- [x] Implement method to list available expirations for a date
- [x] Implement method to fetch options chain for specific expiration
- [x] Ensure all methods return Effect types with proper error handling

## Technical Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Service Structure Setup
```typescript
// src/services/ThetaDataApiClient.ts
- Define ThetaDataApiClient interface with all required methods
- Create Context.Tag for the service
- Define error types (ConnectionError, ApiError, RateLimitError)
```

### Task 2: HTTP Client Configuration
```typescript
// src/services/ThetaDataApiClient.ts
- Configure Effect HTTP client with base URL
- Set appropriate timeouts (30s for data requests)
- Add request/response interceptors for logging
```

### Task 3: Core API Methods
```typescript
// Implementation priority order:
1. healthCheck() - Verify terminal connection
   - GET http://127.0.0.1:25510/v2/system/mdds/status
   - Returns: "CONNECTED" | "UNVERIFIED" | "DISCONNECTED" | "ERROR"
   - Map to domain model with isConnected boolean and timestamp
2. listExpirations(date: string) - Get available expiration dates
3. getOptionsChain(date: string, expiration: string) - Fetch options data
```

### Task 4: Concurrency Control
```typescript
// src/services/ThetaDataApiClient.ts
- Implement request queue with Semaphore
- Add configuration for max concurrent requests
- Test with various concurrency levels
```

### Task 5: Error Handling & Retry
```typescript
// src/services/ThetaDataApiClient.ts
- Implement retry policy with exponential backoff
- Handle specific error codes (429 rate limit, 503 unavailable)
- Provide clear error messages for debugging
```

### Task 6: Test Implementation
```typescript
// src/layers/ThetaDataApiClientTest.ts
- Create test layer with mocked HTTP responses
- Implement mock data fixtures for each endpoint
- Add controllable failure modes for testing
```

### Task 7: Integration with CLI
```typescript
// src/cli/commands/health.ts
- Extend health command to check ThetaData connection
- Display Terminal version and status
- Show configured concurrency and retry settings
```

## Definition of Done

### Code Quality
- [x] All TypeScript strict mode checks pass
- [x] No ESLint/Biome warnings or errors
- [x] Code follows established patterns from Story 1.1
- [x] All exports properly indexed in service directories

### Testing
- [x] Unit tests achieve >90% coverage for service
- [x] All test scenarios from acceptance criteria covered
- [x] Tests run successfully with `bun test`
- [x] Mock layer properly isolates external dependencies

### Documentation
- [x] Service interface fully documented with JSDoc
- [x] Configuration options documented in AppConfig
- [x] Error types and handling documented
- [x] Usage examples provided in service comments

### Integration
- [x] Health command successfully checks Terminal connection
- [x] Service properly integrated with dependency injection
- [x] Logging provides sufficient debugging information
- [x] Service layer can be swapped between Live and Test

### Performance
- [x] Concurrent requests don't exceed configured limit
- [x] Memory usage remains stable during operations
- [x] Retry delays follow exponential backoff pattern
- [x] No memory leaks in long-running operations

## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies
- Story 1.1 must be complete (âœ… Completed)
- ThetaData Terminal must be installed and running locally
- Effect HTTP client documentation for proper usage

### Risks
- **Terminal Availability**: Terminal must be running for development/testing
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive test layer with mocked responses
- **API Rate Limits**: Unknown rate limits from Terminal
  - *Mitigation*: Conservative default concurrency (2), configurable limits
- **Connection Stability**: Local Terminal connection might drop
  - *Mitigation*: Robust retry logic with exponential backoff

## Notes for Development

1. Start with the test layer to enable TDD approach
2. Use existing StatusService as reference for service structure
3. Ensure all async operations use Effect's managed resources
4. Consider adding metrics collection for future monitoring (Story 4.x)
5. Keep API methods generic enough to support future data types beyond SPX

## Validation Checklist

Before marking this story as complete:
- [x] Can successfully connect to local ThetaData Terminal
- [x] Can list expirations for a given trade date
- [x] Can fetch options data for a specific expiration
- [x] Handles Terminal offline scenario gracefully
- [x] Respects configured concurrency limits
- [x] Retries transient failures appropriately
- [x] All tests pass in both Live and Test configurations
- [x] Health command shows Terminal status correctly
