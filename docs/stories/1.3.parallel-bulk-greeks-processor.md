# Story 1.3: Parallel Bulk Greeks Processor Service

**Story ID**: 1.3  
**Epic**: Epic 1 - Foundation & Streaming Pipeline  
**Status**: Complete ✅  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days  
**Created**: 2025-08-07  
**Approved**: 2025-08-07  
**Completed**: 2025-08-07  

## User Story

**As a** system,  
**I want** to process bulk options Greeks data requests by expiration date in parallel,  
**So that** I can efficiently download all data while respecting API constraints.

## Context

Following the completion of Stories 1.1 and 1.2, we now have:
- Effect-TS project structure with service layers
- ThetaDataApiClient service with retry logic and error handling
- Health check functionality verifying Terminal connection
- Usage-level concurrency control pattern established
- Test framework with Live and Test layers

This story builds upon the client service to create an efficient parallel processing system for downloading options data organized by expiration dates.

## Acceptance Criteria

[x] 1. List all available expirations for the trade date
[x] 2. Create parallel processor using configured concurrency limit (2-4 requests)
[x] 3. Fetch bulk Greeks data for each expiration independently using getBulkOptionsGreeks
[x] 4. Add queue management for pending expirations
[x] 5. Create test scenarios with various concurrency configurations
[x] 6. Ensure proper error handling per expiration (one failure doesn't stop others)
[x] 7. Track metrics on processing times and success rates per expiration

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context from Previous Stories

**Service Layer Pattern (from Story 1.1):**
- Use Effect Context.Tag for service definition
- Create Live and Test layer implementations
- Follow dependency injection pattern established

**ThetaData Integration (from Story 1.2):**
- ThetaDataApiClient provides `listExpirations()` and `getBulkOptionsGreeks()` methods
- Concurrency is controlled at usage level via Effect.all
- Default concurrency: 2, max: 4 (configurable via AppConfig)
- Each request has retry logic with exponential backoff built-in

**Key Implementation Details:**
```typescript
// From ThetaDataApiClient interface
listExpirations(): Effect.Effect<ReadonlyArray<ExpirationDate>, ...>
getBulkOptionsGreeks(params: BulkOptionsGreeksParams): Effect.Effect<ReadonlyArray<OptionsGreeksData>, ...>

// BulkOptionsGreeksParams for each expiration:
interface BulkOptionsGreeksParams {
  root: string           // 'SPXW'
  expiration: string     // YYYYMMDD format
  startDate: string      // Trade date in YYYYMMDD
  endDate: string        // Same as startDate for single day
  interval?: number      // Optional interval in ms
  rth?: boolean         // Regular trading hours flag
}

// ExpirationDate type includes:
interface ExpirationDate {
  date: string        // YYYY-MM-DD format
  daysToExpiration: number
}
```

**Project Structure:**
```
src/
  services/
    BulkGreeksProcessor.ts    # Service interface
  layers/
    BulkGreeksProcessorLive.ts # Live implementation
    BulkGreeksProcessorTest.ts # Test implementation
  models/
    ProcessingMetrics.ts      # Metrics types
test/
  services/
    BulkGreeksProcessor.test.ts  # Unit tests
  integration/
    BulkGreeksProcessorLive.integration.test.ts  # Integration tests
```

### Testing Standards

**Test Framework:** Bun test runner
**Test Locations:** 
- Unit tests: `test/services/BulkGreeksProcessor.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `test/integration/BulkGreeksProcessorLive.integration.test.ts`
**Coverage Target:** >90% for service implementation

**Test Patterns to Follow:**
- Use `describe` and `it` blocks for organization
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Use Effect.runPromise for async tests
- Provide both Live and Test layer configurations
- Test concurrency behavior explicitly
- Integration tests should use `describe.skipIf(!SHOULD_RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS)`

**Integration Test Pattern (from ThetaDataApiClientLive.integration.test.ts):**
```typescript
const SHOULD_RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS = process.env.THETA_DATA_TERMINAL_URL !== undefined

describe.skipIf(!SHOULD_RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS)('BulkGreeksProcessorLive Integration Tests', () => {
  it('should process real expirations in parallel', async () => {
    // Test with real Terminal connection
  })
})
```

**Example Unit Test Structure:**
```typescript
describe('BulkGreeksProcessor', () => {
  describe('processBulkGreeks', () => {
    it('should process multiple expirations in parallel', async () => {
      // Test implementation with mocked data
    })
  })
})
```

## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies
- Story 1.1: Project Setup (✅ Complete)
- Story 1.2: ThetaData Client (✅ Complete)
- AppConfig service for configuration
- ThetaDataApiClient for data fetching

### Risks
- **Large Expiration Sets**: Many expirations could overwhelm queue
  - *Mitigation*: Implement batching if needed
- **Memory Usage**: Processing many expirations simultaneously
  - *Mitigation*: Concurrency limits, streaming in next story
- **Metric Overhead**: Tracking could impact performance
  - *Mitigation*: Lightweight metrics, optional detailed tracking

## Notes for Development

1. Start with the service interface to establish the contract
2. Use TDD approach - write tests first
3. Leverage Effect.all's built-in concurrency control
4. Keep metrics lightweight but informative
5. Ensure service remains generic for future data types beyond SPX
6. Consider adding a progress callback for UI integration
