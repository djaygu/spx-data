# Project Brief: SPX Options Data Pipeline Tool

## Executive Summary

**SPX Options Data Pipeline Tool** is a CLI-based data acquisition system that streamlines the collection and preparation of SPX options data for quantitative analysis. Built entirely on Effect-TS, it provides a reliable, memory-efficient streaming pipeline that downloads both historical and current options data from thetadata API, with built-in scheduling capabilities to maintain up-to-date datasets. The system stores all data as integrity-validated parquet files, enabling robust backtesting workflows and continuous analysis of options trading strategies.

## Problem Statement

Quantitative options traders and researchers face significant challenges in acquiring and maintaining reliable SPX options data for backtesting and analysis. Current solutions often suffer from:

- **Data Quality Issues**: Inconsistent formats, missing data points, and lack of integrity validation make it difficult to trust historical analyses
- **Manual Processes**: Most traders resort to manual downloads or custom scripts that break frequently, leading to gaps in data coverage
- **Memory Constraints**: Processing large options chains (with thousands of strikes and expirations) often causes memory overflow in traditional batch processing approaches
- **Update Complexity**: Keeping datasets current requires complex orchestration between historical backfills and daily updates, often resulting in duplicate or missing data
- **Format Lock-in**: Data often comes in formats unsuitable for modern analytical tools, requiring extensive transformation work

The urgency is heightened by the growing complexity of options markets and the need for more sophisticated backtesting to remain competitive in algorithmic trading.

## Proposed Solution

The SPX Options Data Pipeline Tool leverages Effect-TS's powerful streaming and error handling capabilities to create a robust, production-grade data acquisition system. The solution provides:

**Core Approach:**
- A streaming pipeline architecture that processes options data incrementally, eliminating memory constraints even for large historical datasets
- Built-in data integrity validation at every stage, ensuring only clean, consistent data reaches storage
- Intelligent scheduling system that seamlessly handles both historical backfills and incremental updates without duplicates
- CLI commands that provide fine-grained control over data acquisition, from specific date ranges to real-time updates

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Effect-TS Foundation**: Unlike traditional Node.js scripts, our Effect-based architecture provides automatic retry logic, comprehensive error tracking, and resource-safe operations
- **Streaming-First Design**: Process millions of options contracts without memory issues through carefully designed streaming transformations
- **Parquet-Native Storage**: Direct output to columnar format optimized for analytical workloads, eliminating post-processing steps
- **Operational Excellence**: Built-in observability, progress tracking, and resumable operations for production reliability

This solution succeeds where others fail by treating data acquisition as a critical production system rather than a one-off script, with all the reliability and operational features that implies.

- **Timeline:** MVP target of 2-3 months for core functionality
- **Resources:** Single developer with Effect-TS expertise
- **Technical:** thetadata API rate limits (must respect quotas and implement proper backoff)
- **Storage:** Local development limited to available SSD space (~2TB)

### Key Assumptions
- thetadata API will remain stable and maintain current data quality standards
- Effect-TS ecosystem provides all necessary primitives without requiring external libraries
- 1-minute tick data granularity is sufficient for most options backtesting strategies
- Users have valid thetadata API subscriptions with appropriate data access rights
- Parquet format will provide sufficient compression to make 50-100GB datasets manageable
- M4 MacBook Pro performance characteristics will translate well to containerized Linux environments
- Network interruptions are temporary and can be recovered via retry logic

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks
- **API Dependency:** Complete reliance on thetadata API availability and data quality - any API changes could break the pipeline
- **Data Volume:** Underestimating storage/processing requirements for full options chains with 1-minute granularity
- **Effect-TS Complexity:** Learning curve for Effect patterns might slow development, especially for advanced streaming scenarios
- **Memory Pressure:** Despite streaming design, certain operations (sorting, grouping) might still cause memory spikes
- **Parquet Library Maturity:** Node.js Parquet libraries may not be as mature as Python equivalents, potentially causing issues
- **Concurrency Limits:** Standard tier only provides 2 server-allocated threads, requiring careful request management

### Open Questions
- What's the optimal batch size for maximizing throughput within the 2-thread standard tier limit?
- How should we handle the HTTP_CONCURRENCY configuration to avoid timeouts?
- Should we make the concurrency configurable between 2-4 threads for testing vs production?
- How to best implement resumable downloads if a large date range download fails midway?
- What's the optimal partitioning strategy for Parquet files (by date? by expiration?)

### Areas Needing Further Research
- Benchmark different Node.js Parquet libraries for performance and stability
- Test Effect Streams performance with realistic data volumes
- Determine optimal HTTP_CONCURRENCY value for Standard tier (likely 2-4)
- Research thetadata API error codes and recovery strategies
- Evaluate compression algorithms for best size/speed tradeoff with 50-100GB datasets
