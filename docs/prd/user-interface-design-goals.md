# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

A professional-grade CLI tool that feels native to quantitative researchers' workflows, providing clear feedback, intelligent defaults, and recoverable operations. The interface should minimize cognitive load by using familiar command patterns while providing rich progress information for long-running operations.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

• **Command-based operations** with intuitive verbs and flags (download, validate, status)
• **Progressive disclosure** - simple commands for common tasks, advanced flags for power users
• **Real-time feedback** through progress bars, ETAs, and status updates
• **Fail-safe by default** - confirmations for destructive operations, automatic resume capabilities
• **Pipe-friendly output** - structured output formats that integrate with Unix toolchains

## Core Screens and Views

• **Progress Display** - Real-time download progress with speed, ETA, and records processed
• **Status Summary** - Overview of downloaded data, gaps, and last update times
• **Error Display** - Clear error messages with suggested remediation steps
• **Help System** - Contextual help with examples for each command
• **Configuration Display** - Current settings including API credentials status

## Accessibility: None

*Standard CLI accessibility relies on terminal emulator capabilities*

## Branding

Clean, professional output using ASCII characters only for maximum compatibility. Consistent use of color coding: green for success, yellow for warnings, red for errors, blue for informational messages. Progress bars using standard Unicode block characters.

## Target Device and Platforms: Desktop Only

macOS (M4 MacBook Pro) for initial development, with future containerization enabling Linux deployment. Terminal width assumption of 80+ characters for proper formatting.
