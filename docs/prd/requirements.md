# Requirements

## Functional

• **FR1:** Download historical SPX options data for any date range with automatic pagination and progress tracking
• **FR2:** Support parallel downloads with configurable concurrency (2-4 threads) for faster data acquisition
• **FR3:** Process options data through memory-efficient streaming pipeline handling 50K+ records/minute
• **FR4:** Validate data integrity ensuring all required fields are present and within valid ranges before storage
• **FR5:** Store all data as Apache Parquet files with proper schema enforcement and compression
• **FR6:** Provide CLI commands for common operations (e.g., `download --start-date 2023-01-01 --end-date 2023-12-31`)
• **FR7:** Detect existing data to enable incremental updates and avoid re-downloading
• **FR8:** Display real-time progress bars with ETA calculations for long-running operations
• **FR9:** Automatically retry failed requests with exponential backoff
• **FR10:** Resume interrupted downloads within 5 minutes of failure
• **FR11:** Support downloading 1-minute tick granularity data for SPX options
• **FR12:** Respect ThetaData Terminal concurrency limits with proper request management

## Non Functional

• **NFR1:** Maintain memory utilization below 75% when processing full options chains
• **NFR2:** Achieve 99.9% data completeness rate for specified date ranges
• **NFR3:** Complete 95% of scheduled runs without manual intervention
• **NFR4:** Process and store 1 year of SPX data (50-100GB) without memory overflow
• **NFR5:** Achieve >5:1 compression ratio using Parquet format vs CSV
• **NFR6:** Support operation on macOS (M4 MacBook Pro) with 24GB minimum RAM using Bun runtime
• **NFR7:** Rely on ThetaData Terminal for authentication, no API keys in application
• **NFR8:** Provide clear error messages and logging for debugging failed operations
• **NFR9:** Bundle as single binary with all dependencies for easy deployment
• **NFR10:** Ensure data queries via DuckDB/pandas run 10x faster than CSV equivalents
