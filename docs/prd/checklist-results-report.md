## Key Findings

**Strengths:**
- Clear problem definition with quantified impact (20-30% time savings)
- Well-scoped MVP focusing on core SPX data acquisition
- Comprehensive epic structure with clear dependencies
- Strong technical foundation with Effect-TS architecture

**Areas for Enhancement:**
- Trading calendar specification for date range processing
- Technical risk analysis for Parquet library selection
- Data flow visualization would aid understanding

## Recommendations

1. **Add trading calendar logic** in Story 3.1 for accurate date range handling
2. **Include Parquet library benchmarking** as part of Story 2.1
3. **Document CSV to Parquet migration path** between Epic 1 and 2
4. **Consider adding data flow diagram** in architecture phase

**Verdict**: PRD is ready for architectural design phase with minor enhancements to be addressed during implementation.
