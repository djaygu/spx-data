# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

• Reduce data management overhead by 80% through automated, reliable SPX options data acquisition
• Achieve 99.9% data completeness with automatic gap detection and recovery
• Enable processing of 5+ years of historical data without memory constraints
• Provide data within 2 hours of market close with zero manual intervention
• Create a production-grade CLI tool that "just works" for quantitative researchers

## Background Context

The SPX Options Data Pipeline Tool addresses critical challenges faced by quantitative options traders who currently lose 20-30% of their research time to data management tasks. Built entirely on Effect-TS with Bun runtime, this CLI tool provides a streaming pipeline that downloads both historical and current SPX options data from locally running ThetaData Terminal, storing it as integrity-validated Parquet files. The tool's streaming architecture eliminates memory constraints that plague traditional batch processing approaches, while built-in scheduling capabilities ensure datasets remain current without manual intervention.
